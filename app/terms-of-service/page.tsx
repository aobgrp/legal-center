              <ol className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4 list-decimal list-inside">
                <li>
                  The information provided on the Site summarizes an outline of certain terms and conditions of the insurance proposed by the insurers and/or benefit services, based on the information provided by your company. The insurance policies and/or benefit services themselves must be read to fully understand the terms, coverages, exclusions, limitations and/or conditions of the actual policy contract of insurance and/or benefit service. Policy forms are available on the user site. <strong>We make no warranties with respect to policy limits or coverage considerations of the carrier.</strong> Any entity not named in the application and resulting policy may not be an insured entity. This may include affiliates, subsidiaries, LLC's, partnerships and joint ventures. Contact us with questions on these or any other issues of concern.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Although Gallagher is responsible for the placement of lines of coverage specified on the Site and in the applicable application, and/or the procurement of any benefit service, Gallagher is acting at your direction. You have the sole discretion for the selection and approval of any insurance placed, benefit service purchased, as well as other material decisions involving your risk management, risk transfer, benefit services, and/or loss prevention needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gallagher is not required to provide Services to you if Gallagher reasonably considers that to do so would put Gallagher in breach of, or would expose Gallagher or its affiliates to fines, penalties or sanctions under any laws, regulations, professional rules or, in Gallagher's sole opinion, you have breached a term/the terms of the Policies. In such circumstances, Gallagher will be entitled to terminate its Services with immediate effect. In the event that Gallagher exercises its right to terminate its Services with immediate effect, Gallagher will not be responsible or liable to you for any direct or indirect loss which you or any other party may suffer as a result.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Please be aware that Gallagher is generally restricted from providing broking, claims handling or other services that relate to Cuba and Iran, including due to significant difficulties in processing payments and other commercial and reputational considerations.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Compensation Disclosure</h2>
              <ol className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4 list-decimal list-inside">
                <li>
                  Gallagher companies are primarily compensated from the usual and customary commissions, fees or, where permitted, a combination of both, for brokerage and servicing of insurance policies, annuity contracts, guarantee contracts and surety bonds (collectively "insurance coverages") handled for a client's account, which may vary based on market conditions and the insurance product placed for the client.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In placing, renewing, consulting on or servicing insurance coverages, Gallagher companies may participate in contingent and supplemental commission arrangements with intermediaries and insurance companies that provide for additional compensation if certain underwriting, profitability, volume or retention goals are achieved. Such goals are typically based on the total amount of certain insurance coverages placed by Gallagher with the insurance company, not on an individual policy basis. As a result, Gallagher may be considered to have an incentive to place insurance coverages with a particular insurance company. If you do not wish to have your commercial insurance placement included in consideration for additional compensation, contact your producer or service team for an opt-out form.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gallagher companies may receive investment income on fiduciary funds temporarily held by them, or from obtaining or generating premium finance quotes, unless prohibited by law.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gallagher companies may also access or have an ownership interest in other facilities, including wholesalers, reinsurance intermediaries, captive managers, underwriting managers and others that act as intermediaries for both Gallagher and other brokers in the insurance marketplace some of which may earn and retain customary brokerage commission and fees for their work.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                If you have specific questions about any compensation received by Gallagher and its affiliates in relation to your insurance placements and/or enrollment, please contact your Gallagher representative for more details.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Gallagher does not expect that it will have a formal dispute with any of its clients. However, in the event that one should arise, we should each strive to achieve a fair, expedient and efficient resolution and we'd like to clearly outline the resolution process. If the parties have a dispute regarding Gallagher's services, the relationship governed by this Site ("Dispute"), or specific provisions in these Terms of Service, each party agrees to resolve that Dispute by mediation. The Dispute will be governed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures. All Dispute resolutions will take place in Chicago, IL, unless you and Gallagher agree to another location. If mediation fails to resolve the Dispute, you and Gallagher agree to binding arbitration. The parties will equally divide all costs of the mediation and arbitration proceedings and will each pay their own attorneys' fees. Each party waives all rights to commence litigation in court to resolve a Dispute, and specifically waives all rights to pursue relief by class action or mass action in court or through arbitration. However, the parties do not waive the ability to seek a court order of injunction in aid of the mediation and arbitration required by these Terms.
