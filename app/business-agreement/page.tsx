              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
                From time to time, Gallagher (we, us or Gallagher) may be required by law to provide to you certain written notices or disclosures.  Described below are the terms and conditions for providing to you such notices and disclosures electronically through the website where this document is linked.  By completing a transaction through the website, you are acknowledging that you have read the information below carefully and thoroughly and confirming that you can access this information electronically to your satisfaction and that you agree to these terms and conditions.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
                At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available electronically to you by us.  You may request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the procedure described below.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
                You may at any time withdraw your consent to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, and request that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format by providing notice as described below.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Consequences of Withdrawing Consent</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
                It will take significantly longer for us to deliver notices and disclosures in paper format, and certain third parties that generate any such documentation may not provide all documentation in paper format.  However, if you desire to withdraw your consent, you must do so by emailing Gallagher at <a href="mailto:members@aobgrp.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">members@aobgrp.com</a> with your specific request to receive paper documentation.  This will indicate to us that you have withdrawn your consent to receive required notices and disclosures electronically from us.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">All Notices and Disclosures Will Be Sent to You Electronically</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
                Unless you inform us of your intent to withdraw consent per the email process specified above, we will provide electronically to you by email or through the website all required notices, disclosures, authorizations, acknowledgements and other documents that are required to be provided or made available to you during the course of our relationship with you.  To reduce the chance of you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the required notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you have given us.  Thus, you can receive all the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper format through the paper mail delivery system.  If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as described below.
